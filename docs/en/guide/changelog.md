# Version Release

## Version Control Explanation

Due to the Blossom code repository containing multi-platform code, it does not strictly follow semantic versioning. However, versions still have clear meanings:

- **Major Version `(v1.x.x)`**: Change in major version indicates a significant architectural overhaul, major feature changes, or significant incompatible modifications.

- **Minor Version `(v1.2.x)`**: Change in minor version indicates modifications to server-side code, requiring a redeployment of server-side code.

- **Patch Version `(v1.2.1)`**: Change in patch version indicates modifications on the client or blog side. Only requires redownloading the client or blog. Different patch versions of the client use the same server-side version, for example, both client versions `v1.2.1` and `v1.2.2` use the server-side version `v1.2.0`.

:::danger Note
If you are using a client and blog integrated with the backend, you need to redeploy regardless of the version change.
