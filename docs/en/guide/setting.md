Click "Yes", and the image access address will be automatically configured as [login+`/pic`]. Then enter the blog configuration. There are two ways to access the blog:

1. Use the built-in blog.
2. Use the independently deployed blog.

### Built-in Blog

Usually, click "Confirm to use the built-in blog" to complete the configuration. The built-in blog is provided by default to users with USER_ID 1. If you want to modify this default value, you can refer to [Blog/Mobile Page](./deploy/blog).

In the blog preview on the right, you can see the user ID of the current blog configuration, which is convenient for checking with the current login user ID.

When you correctly fill in the blog address, the blog preview will be displayed as shown below, showing the user ID configured for the blog, making it easy to check with the current login user ID.
